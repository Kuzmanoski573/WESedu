# WESedu
🚀 Welcome to my repository "WESedu_site"! 🌟 

My first project at Seavus Education and Development Center, completed on December 29, 2022. This is a recreation of the project. This project is after the Photoshop course at the academy and I decided to turn the design into a site. This foundational knowledge fuels my ongoing pursuit of excellence in web development and design.

🎨 Step into the world of my achievements and experiences, presented in "WESedu", a methically crafted site designed as part of the course to showcase my mastery of using Photoshop to create visually expressive digital artwork.

🔧 "WESedu" is meticulously crafted using HTML5 and CSS3, symbolizing my dedication to the craft of web development.
